    <br> Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
    <ul>
        <li>Walla Walla</li>
        <li>WA</li>
        <li>Magic City</li>
        <li>ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful</li>
        <li>UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance</li>
    </ul>
    Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.

As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
